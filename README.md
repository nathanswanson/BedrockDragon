# BedrockDragon

This is a passion project by me to create the most efficient decentralized server I can. This project uses zero minecraft code and is built from scratch
.

## Framework

The server is structured around kotlin coroutine and sharable flows. A netty thread controls the IO of the server and passes packet information to the
coroutine network.


## Current Status

Currently, I am developing this as my main project.

- Players can join
- World is loaded from save with some bugs
- basic inventory system
- custom block and item DSL
- Players can move around world
- chat
- chunk loading with some bugs
- basic block interaction
## Current Todo

- fix chunk loading bugs
- fix odd parity palettes in chunk loading from looking odd.
- skins




## Contributing

Contributing is currently closed unless invited until a solid framework is finished.

### Guide

You must have:
- A copy of Windows 10 Minecraft
- Intelij IDEA. I'm sure another editor would work but this is built to support IDEA
