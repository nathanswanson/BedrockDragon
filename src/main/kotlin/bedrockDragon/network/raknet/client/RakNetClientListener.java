 * Event methods are called on the same thread that called them. Typically, this
 * is the NIO event loop group that the client is using, or the client thread

 * takes too long to respond (typically
 * {@value com.whirvis.jraknet.peer.RakNetPeer#PEER_TIMEOUT} milliseconds) then
 * the client can actually timeout.
 * <p>
 * To have event methods called on their own dedicated thread, annotate the
